Eurovoc-Classifier-Java
=======================

By default the application looks for a configuration file named `application.conf` in the `resources` folder.

Set the location of the configuration file using:

```sh
-Dconfig.file=<path-to-configuration-file> 
```

For example, when running the app on the command line:

```sh
java -Dconfig.file=<path-to-configuration-file> -jar insideout-eurovoc-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```
